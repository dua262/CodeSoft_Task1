# Restaurant Chatbot (Rule-Based)

## Overview
This project is a rule-based chatbot designed for a restaurant, specifically for a restaurant named "Roadside Cafe." The chatbot is intended to interact with customers, answer their questions, provide information about the restaurant's services, and assist with various inquiries related to dining at Roadside Cafe.

The chatbot is built on a set of predefined rules and intents, and it uses natural language processing techniques to understand and respond to user input.

## Features
- **Intent-Based Responses:** The chatbot is equipped with a set of predefined intents that cover a range of customer queries and interactions, including menu inquiries, reservation requests, event information, and more.

- **Natural Language Understanding:** The chatbot uses natural language processing techniques to understand user input. It can identify the intent of the user's message and respond accordingly.

- **Multiple User Scenarios:** The chatbot handles various scenarios, such as providing restaurant information, answering questions about the menu, taking reservations, and offering assistance with special occasions.

- **Fallback Responses:** In case the chatbot cannot identify the user's intent, it provides a fallback response to guide the conversation or ask the user to rephrase their question.

## Prerequisites
Before running the chatbot, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **Python Environment:** You need a Python environment with the required libraries installed. Check the `requirements.txt` file for the list of dependencies.

- **Data Files:** The chatbot relies on data files, including `intents.json`, `words.pkl`, and `classes.pkl`. These files contain predefined intents, vocabulary, and classes for the chatbot to understand user input.

## Procedure
1. **Installation:** Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Data Files:** Make sure you have the data files (`intents.json`, `words.pkl`, and `classes.pkl`) in the project directory. These files are crucial for the chatbot to function correctly.

3. **Run the Chatbot:** Execute the chatbot script to start interacting with it. The chatbot will provide a conversation interface and respond to user input based on predefined intents.

4. **Interact:** Engage with the chatbot by typing in your questions, inquiries, or requests. The chatbot will provide responses based on its predefined rules and intents.

5. **Exiting the Session:** To end the chatbot session, simply type "bye," and the chatbot will gracefully exit.

## Customization
You can customize the chatbot's behavior by modifying the `intents.json` file. Add new intents, patterns, and responses to enhance the chatbot's capabilities and tailor it to the specific needs of Roadside Cafe.
